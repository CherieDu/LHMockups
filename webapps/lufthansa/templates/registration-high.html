                    <h5><b>Cookies</b></h5>
                    <p>
                    Lufthansa.com uses cookies to recognize you and personalize Lufthansa.com. When you visit Lufthansa.com a cookie may (depending on your browser settings) be saved to your computer. This cookie allows us to recognize you on subsequent visits and provide a more tailored and pleasant browsing experience. 
                    </p>
                    <h5><b>Encryption</b></h5>
                    <p>Anytime you send data to Lufthansa.com the communication is encrypted using SSL. This means that only you and Lufthansa.com can see the conversation. This protects your personal data, your address or your vacation plans for example, from being disclosed to unwanted or unknown parties. Everything you do on Lufthansa.com stays between you and Lufthansa.</p>

                    <h5><b>Data Sharing</b></h5>
                    <p>We value your privacy and try to limit our data sharing. We do not share data with third parties. Lufthansa is required to share passenger data with many destination countries however. This data can be thought of as being similar to what a passport would contain. In the case of the United States specifically, all transfers fall under Safe Harbor. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that passengers provide their full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening and security. Lufthansa must also comply with any government requests done through proper legal frameworks. Due to this, Lufthansa may share your data with government agencies or authorities.
                    </p>
                    <h5><b>Data Collection & Storage</b></h5>
                    <p>Lufthansa collects any personal data that you provide to us. For instance, the data provided during registration or booking a flight. Lufthansa.com will also log your IP address for the purposes of analytics and pursuing civil law claims. These analytics are only performed using anonymous, aggregate data. You can request to view your information at any time and correct the data should it be incorrect in some way.</p>

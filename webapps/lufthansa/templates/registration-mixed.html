                  <p>
                  EUAir.com uses cookies to recognize you and personalize EUAir.com. When you visit EUAir.com a cookie may (depending on your browser settings) be saved to your computer. This cookie allows us to recognize you on subsequent visits and provide a more tailored and pleasant browsing experience. 
                  </p>

                  <h4>Encryption</h4>
                  <p>Anytime you send data to EUAir.com the communication is encrypted using SSL. This means that only you and EUAir.com can see the conversation. This protects your personal data and all your other information (address, travel plans, etc) from being disclosed to unwanted or unknown parties. Everything you do on EUAir.com stays between you and EUAir.</p>

                  <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
                  <p>We value your privacy and try to limit our data sharing. We do not share your data with third parties. However, EUAir is required to share passenger data with many destination countries. This data can be thought of as being similar to what a passport would contain. In the case of the United States specifically, all transfers fall under Safe Harbor. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that passengers provide their full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watchlist screening and security. EUAir must also comply with any government requests to access personal data, if such requests are performed through proper legal frameworks. 
                  </p>
                  <h4>Data Collection & Storage</h4>
                  <p>EUAir collects any personal data provided by you. For instance, the data provided by you during registration or while booking a flight is collected by EUAir. EUAir.com will also log your IP address for the purposes of analytics and pursuing civil law claims. These analytics are only performed using anonymous, aggregate data. You can place a request to view your information at any time and correct the data should it be incorrect in some way.</p>

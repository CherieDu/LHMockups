        Terms and conditions for EUAir websites
      </h1>
      <p>
        These are the terms and conditions for all the websites operated by EUAir.
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>EUAir ID is our first venture into offering customer-focused personalization across everything EUAir! With an EUAir ID you can:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>View and manage all of your planned flights and flight history</li>
            <li>Book flights with a single click with the pre-filled data option</li>
            <li>Receive a personalized EUAir newsletter</li>
            <li>Receive exclusive deals on flights</li>
            <li>Be the first to hear about affordable flights to dream destinations</li>
            <li>Ability to upgrade your account to take advantage of our frequent flyer program (or integrate your current frequent flyer account!)</li>
            <li>... And much more!</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>EUAir ID can only provide these benefits by collecting, storing, and processing your personal information. To create an EUAir ID account we require only a valid email address. If you want more from your EUAir ID, you can opt-in to additional benefits (which may require additional personal information) at your choosing from the privacy preference panel.</p>

        Cookies
      </h4>

      <p>
        EUAir.com uses cookies to recognize you and personalize EUAir.com. When you visit EUAir.com a cookie may (depending on your browser settings) be saved to your computer. This cookie allows us to recognize you on subsequent visits and provide a more tailored and pleasant browsing experience. 
      </p>
      <h4 id = "proprietary-rights" class="page-header">
        Encryption
      </h4>
      <p>Anytime you send data to EUAir.com the communication is encrypted using SSL. This means that only you and EUAir.com can see the conversation. This protects your personal data and all your other information (address, travel plans, etc) from being disclosed to unwanted or unknown parties. Everything you do on EUAir.com stays between you and EUAir.</p>

      <h4 id = "permissible-use" class="page-header">
        Data Sharing
      </h4>
      <p>
        We value your privacy and try to limit our data sharing. We do not share your data with third parties. However, EUAir is required to share passenger data with many destination countries. This data can be thought of as being similar to what a passport would contain. In the case of the United States specifically, all transfers fall under Safe Harbor. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that passengers provide their full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watchlist screening and security. EUAir must also comply with any government requests to access personal data, if such requests are performed through proper legal frameworks.       
      </p>

      <h4 id = "consequences-of-improper-use" class="page-header">
        Data Collection & Storage
      </h4>
      <p>
        EUAir collects any personal data provided by you. For instance, the data provided by you during registration or while booking a flight is collected by EUAir. EUAir.com will also log your IP address for the purposes of analytics and pursuing civil law claims. These analytics are only performed using anonymous, aggregate data. You can place a request to view your information at any time and correct the data should it be incorrect in some way.
